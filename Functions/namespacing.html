  allows you to protect any variables that you have in your
  modules from any global scoped variables.	This is really
  important because in any module, you might be using some
  variables that are already used by other things in that application.

  we already know that we can easily encapsulate our functions within
  parentheses, and that protects all the variables inside those
  functions from the global scope.	But what if we want access to
  those variables from within our application? To do that, we need
  to create a variable and assign it to our self-executing function.
  And that way we'll have access to things inside it.

  /*access 'ray' with a return statement
  instead of returning a statement, we can return an object, and through the object we can create variables and functions.

  return {

      console.log('hello');

//Call the function with dot notation

/*
Now you can access that module from within your main application, while protecting all namespaces.
